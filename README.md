## 🛑 Problem  
In today’s job market, skills and experience alone aren’t enough.  
- Careers are fluid — people move between jobs, projects, and industries faster than ever.  
- Feedback fades quickly once projects end or teams change.  
- LinkedIn recommendations exist, but they’re vague, scarce, and tied to one platform.  
- Employers and clients increasingly expect **proof, not just claims**.  

Professionals lack a structured, portable way to capture and showcase authentic, project-specific feedback.  

---

## 💡 Solution  
RevYou is a feedback-driven portfolio platform that helps you:  
- **Capture real-time feedback** while it’s still fresh.  
- **Organise insights** into Campaigns (companies, clients, or organisations) and Projects (roles, assignments, collaborations).  
- **Build a shareable profile** of authentic testimonials that highlight your strengths, growth, and achievements.  
- **Stand out in a world of AI-generated CVs** by showcasing the human element — real feedback from real people.  

Whether you’re a developer, freelancer, teacher, student, or volunteer, RevYou helps you:  
1. Showcase your strengths with authentic, verifiable feedback.  
2. Spot growth opportunities through constructive insights.  
3. Bring your CV to life with a dynamic story of your career journey.  

---

## ⏳ Why Now?  
Work has never been more dynamic:  
- Projects end quickly, teams are fluid, and careers span multiple industries.  
- AI makes it easy to generate polished CVs and cover letters — making it harder to stand out.  
- Proof and testimonials are now standard in consumer products and services, but not in careers.  

RevYou fills that gap, giving professionals a **human-first portfolio of feedback** at the moment it’s needed most.  

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Create Campaigns & Projects** to organise your work.
- **Send feedback requests** to colleagues, clients, or team members.
- **Public share links** for specific projects or campaigns.
- **Auth0-powered authentication** for secure access.
- **Structured data storage** in MongoDB Atlas.

---
